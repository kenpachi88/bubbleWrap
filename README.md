# bubbleWrap

this app takes advantage of 3d touch from apple. whereas every other bubblewrap just pops on touch this one implements touch and peek for a simulated haptic feedback with the pop. Since iOS does not allow deeper vibration functions available to the developer i feel this is truly unique.
